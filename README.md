Python Tutor: Basic Concepts
This repository provides a series of introductory lessons for learning basic Python programming concepts. It's designed to help beginners get started with Python through interactive Jupyter Notebooks.

üìö Repository Structure
The repository is organized into distinct lesson modules, each contained within its own folder:

lesson1/: Introduction to Python basics.

lesson2/: Further core Python concepts.

lesson3/: Advanced basic topics and exercises.

Each lesson folder contains Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) that combine explanations, code examples, and exercises to facilitate an interactive learning experience.

‚ú® Features
Beginner-Friendly: Content is tailored for those new to programming or Python.

Interactive Learning: Utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for hands-on coding and immediate feedback.

Structured Lessons: Progresses through fundamental Python topics in a logical order.

üöÄ Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language taught and used in the notebooks.

Jupyter Notebook: The primary environment for creating and interacting with the lesson materials.

üë©‚Äçüíª Getting Started
To access and run these lessons on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.

Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook. The easiest way is via Anaconda, or by using pip:

```
pip install notebook
```

Cloning the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.

Clone the repository using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/1daniel3333/tutor.git
```

Navigate into the cloned directory:

```
cd tutor
```

Running the Notebooks
From the tutor directory in your terminal, start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Your web browser will automatically open a new tab displaying the Jupyter interface.

Navigate through the folders (lesson1, lesson2, lesson3) and click on any .ipynb file to open a lesson.

You can then run the code cells, modify them, and complete exercises directly within the browser.
