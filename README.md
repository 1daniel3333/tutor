## 📚 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into distinct lesson modules, each contained within its own folder:

- `lesson1/`: Introduction to Python basics.
- `lesson2/`: Further core Python concepts.
- `lesson3/`: Advanced basic topics and exercises.

Each lesson folder contains Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) that combine explanations, code examples, and exercises to facilitate an interactive learning experience.

## ✨ Features

- **Beginner-Friendly**: Content is tailored for those new to programming or Python.
- **Interactive Learning**: Utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for hands-on coding and immediate feedback.
- **Structured Lessons**: Progresses through fundamental Python topics in a logical order.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language taught and used in the notebooks.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The primary environment for creating and interacting with the lesson materials.

## 👩‍💻 Getting Started

To access and run these lessons on your local machine, follow these steps:

### ✅ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook. The easiest way is via Anaconda, or by using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

### 🛠️ Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
3. Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1daniel3333/tutor.git
cd tutor
```

### ▶️ Running the Notebooks

From the `tutor` directory in your terminal, start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Your web browser will automatically open a new tab displaying the Jupyter interface.

Navigate through the folders (`lesson1`, `lesson2`, `lesson3`) and click on any `.ipynb` file to open a lesson.

You can then run the code cells, modify them, and complete exercises directly within the browser.
